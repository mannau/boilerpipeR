  <release version='&ParserName; 2.11.0'>
   <desc>
    <p>
     This release expands on Xerces' experimental support for XML Schema 1.1
      by providing implementations for the simplified complex type restriction
      rules (also known as subsumption), xs:override and a few other XML Schema
      1.1 features. This release also introduces experimental support for XML
      Schema Component Designators (SCD). It fixes several bugs which were
      present in &ParserName; 2.10.0 and also includes a few other minor
      enhancements.

     <note>
      Added support for creating UIEvents and MouseEvents through the

    <update>
     <note>
      Improved the reporting of character conversion errors. The CharConversionException 
      which triggered the fatal error is now available from SAXException.getException(). 
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </update>
    <update>
     <note>
      Reduced the performance penalty for using an EOFException internally to 
      signal to the scanner that the end of the document has been reached. The
      exception is now cached, avoiding the expensive fillInStackTrace() on
      creation.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>

    <update>
     <note>
      Improved the performance of the XMLGregorianCalendar implementation.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </update>
    <update>
     <note>
      Implemented improvements in the processing of large minOccurs/maxOccurs on 
      element/wildcard particles which once caused OutOfMemoryErrors to occur during
      validation. Note that an OutOfMemoryError may still occur if the minOccurs/maxOccurs
      are nested or appear on a sequence or choice model group.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </update>
    <update>
     <note>
      Improved the algorithm for checking the <jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#cos-nonambig">Unique Particle Attribution</jump> 
      constraint so that it no longer causes an OutOfMemoryError for content models with large maxOccurs values. Note that this only applies 
      to the checking of schema validity. An OutOfMemoryError may still occur if the schema contains large maxOccurs and is used to validate 
      an instance document.

     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </fix>
    <fix>
     <note>
      Fixed bugs in the implementation of Document.normalizeDocument() where it was not correctly 
      re-evaluating Element.schemaTypeInfo, Attr.schemaTypeInfo, IDness or the 
      [element content whitespace] property of text nodes when validating against a DTD or XML Schema.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </fix>
    <fix>
     <note>
      Fixed a thread-safety bug which could cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or a 
      NullPointerException to be thrown during DTD validation if a grammar pool is shared 
      between multiple parser instances.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </fix>
    <fix>
     <note>
      Fixed a bug in the DOMConfiguration of a Document where it was processing the 
      "schema-location" parameter as an atomic URI value instead of a whitespace separated 
      list of URIs.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </fix>
    <fix>
     <note>
      Fixed a bug in the XInclude implementation where the Locator would report the location 
      of the xi:include element in the top-level document as the location of all the document 
      events in the included document or fragment.
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>
    </fix>
    <fix>
     <note>
      Fixed a bug in the JAXP schema validator which caused it to fail with a third-party DOM 
      Level 3 implementation whose nodes can only be tested for identity using isSameNode().
     </note>
     <submitter name='Michael Glavassevich'/>

    <p>
     As of this release, Xerces and Xalan now share a common serialization codebase.
     The DOM Level 3 serialization support which was in Xerces was migrated into 
     the Xalan serializer and Xerces' native serializer was deprecated. In this release 
     we also upgraded the xml-commons resolver to v1.2 (which provides support for OASIS 
     XML Catalogs v1.1), introduced a few minor features and fixed several bugs.

      Created a new parser configuration which uses a memory sensitive
      SymbolTable which can handle usage scenarios where the names in the 
      XML documents being parsed are mostly unique. The internalized 
      strings stored in this SymbolTable are softly reachable and may be 
      cleared by the garbage collector in response to memory demand.

     <note>
      Modified the DocumentBuilder and LSParser implementations so that they drop 
      their internal references to the DOM they just built. If an application is 
      pooling parsers this will allow the garbage collector to reclaim the Document 
      and all of its nodes if the application no longer has any references to it.

  <release version='&ParserName; 2.8.0'>
   <desc>
    <p>
     This release introduces several new validation related features and provides enhancements 
     to the XML schema annotation support. All of the schema component interfaces in the XML Schema API 
     now have a getAnnotations() method which returns a list of XSAnnotations. This includes annotations 
     on particles and attribute uses which were previously "lost". In addition, in this release we
     implemented support for pretty-printing in the LSSerializer, repaired the warn-on-undeclared-elemdef
     feature which had been broken for several releases and fixed many other bugs.
    </p>

   <changes>
    <add>
     <note>
      Added a getAnnotations() method to each of the component interfaces in the XML Schema API
      (including XSParticle and XSAttributeUse) and implemented the support for the new methods.

  <release version="&ParserName; 2.3.0">
    <desc>
        With this release, the Xerces-J developers are declaring the Xerces
        Native Interface (XNI) core and parsers packages
        to be gold.  
        This release also brings Xerces into compliance with the most recent
        work of the W3C DOM working group on DOM level 3 Core
        and Load/Save, and introduces many fixes to bring Xerces's behaviour 
        into line with XML Schema errata.  Support for the
        parsing of documents written according to the XML 1.1 candidate recommendation 
        has also been completed, except that no option for verifying that documents
        are normalized has yet been implemented.
        Finally, Xerces now provides means by which applications can force
        the parser to reject certain kinds of documents the processing of which could
        result in a denial-of-service attack.

  <release version="&ParserName; 2.0.2">
    <desc>
      In this release, numerous bugs have been fixed.  Only one minor change in the Xerces
      Native Interface is included (documented below); considerable
      new functionality has also been added in terms of PSVI support, DOM level 3, and
      grammar preparsing/caching.
    </desc>
    <changes>
      <add>
	<note>Schema Component API interfaces and implementation; full PSVI support.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Sandy Gao, Elena Litani'/>
      </add>

      <update>
	<note>
	  Add XMLResourceIdentifier to startExternalSubset() method defined in 
	  XNI XMLDTDHandler. 
	  That allows supporting baseURI for an external subset.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Elena Litani'/>
      </update>
      <add>
	<note>
	   Add implementation for baseURI, documentURI, normalizeDocument 
           and required normalize document features. Added support for DOM revalidation 
           against XML Schemas. [DOM Level 3]
	</note>
	<submitter name='Elena Litani'/>
      </add>
      <add>
        <note> 
          Added implementation for compareTreePosition method of DOM L3.
        </note>
        <submitter name='Lisa Martin'/>
      </add>
      <add>
        <note>Added XMLGrammarLoader interface to the xni.grammars package; refactor DTD and 
          Schema validation code to create classes implementing this interface; created
          a convenience class (XMLGrammarPreparser) that uses the new grammar loaders to permit grammar preparsing;
          wrote a sample (xni.XMLGrammarBuilder) that demonstrates how all this works.
        </note>
        <submitter name="Neil Graham"/>
      </add>
      <add>
        <note>
          Reorganized the code in Xerces DOM implementation to expose DOM Level 3
          functionality via org.w3c.dom package.
          Added several build targets for building customized xerces jar files that include
          DOM Level 3 Core and Load/Save interfaces and 
          implementation of those interfaces: jars-dom3, apijar-dom3, sampjar-dom3. 
       </note>
	<submitter name='Arnaud Le Hors, Elena Litani'/>
     </add>
      <update>
	<note>
	  Updated xni.DocumentTracer sample to print augmentations for events.
	  This makes it easier to debug configurations that augment the document's
	  infoset.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Andy Clark'/>
      </update>
      <update>
	<note>
	  Removed dependence on SAX attribute interfaces from XMLAttributesImpl
	  utility class. The AbstractSAXParser already defines a SAX attribute
	  proxy class so that the parser and components can be properly layered.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Andy Clark'/>
      </update>
      <update>
        <note>
            Moved from the org.xml.sax.helpers.AttributesImpl shipped with SAX 2.0 to that
            shipping in 2.0.1.  This solves problems encountered with creating empty
            attribute lists.
        </note>
        <submitter name="Neil Graham"/>
      </update>
      <update>
	<note>
	  Improved handling of settings in parser classes making it easier
	  to re-use the parsers with other parser configurations. Previously,
	  the parser instances assumed that all configurations supported
	  various settings (i.e. the parser would set default values without 
	  first adding the recognized features and property identifiers to
	  the parser configuration).
	</note>
	<submitter name='Andy Clark'/>
      </update>
      <fix>
	<note>
	  Fixed bug in HTML DOM implementation that was causing xerces.dom
	  element nodes to be created instead of the appropriate HTML element
	  nodes.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Andy Clark'/>
      </fix>
      <fix>
	<note>
	  Fixed bug to avoid null pointer exception in AbstractDOMParser when
	  locator information is not available from parser configuration.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Andy Clark'/>
      </fix>
      <fix>
	<note>
	  Fixed bug in WrappedInput/OutputStream classes reported by Morten Bjørhus.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Andy Clark'/>
      </fix>
      
      <fix>
	<note>The DTD validator failed to report 
	  "undeclared element" error if an attribute was 
	  declared for an undeclared element.</note>
	<submitter name='Elena Litani'/>
      </fix>
      <fix>
        <note>Performance fixes:  replaced code that increases array sizes by catching ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions
            with code that checks the sizes of the relevant arrays.  Also streamlined
            several method calls in the DTD Grammar classes to account for the 
            fact that scope is not relevant for this type of grammar.  Finally,
            improved algorithm for recognizing entities and notations.
        </note>
        <submitter name="Henry Zongaro, Neil Graham"/>
      </fix>
      <update>
	<note>
	  Compress jars by default.  We have not done so in the past,
	  and it will be useful to see if this proves problematic or
	  beneficial.
	</note>
	<submitter name="Neil Graham"/>
      </update>
      <add>
	<note>
	  Added several build targets for building customized xercesImpl
	  jar files.  Now we can build a DTD-only version, and a DTD-only
	  version also excluding support for the HTML/WML DOM.
	</note>
	<submitter name="Neil Graham"/>
      </add>
      <fix>
	<note>
	  Parser now reads external entities one chunk at a time, 
	  rather than a character at a time;
	  this increases performance dramatically in certain circumstances.  
	  This fix also allows a number of EBCDIC encodings to work which did
	  not work previously.  
	</note>
	<submitter name="Neil Graham, Henry Zongaro"/>
      </fix>

      <update>
	<note>Performance enhancement: implemented DOM node and 
	  declaration pools that reduce number of objects created 
	  during building of XML Schema grammars.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Elena Litani'/>
      </update>
      <update>
	<note>Improved performance for non-deferred DOM: reduced 
	  number of concatenations for characters (bug #5602)
	</note>
	<submitter name='Elena Litani'/>
      </update>

      <update>
	<note>According to the namespace spec errata, namespace declaration
          attributes should be bound to a special namespace; and errors should
          be reported on illegal bindings of "xmlns" and "xml" prefixes and
          their namespaces.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Sandy Gao'/>
      </update>

      <update>
	<note>Refined schema error messages: provide more descriptive error
          messages for simple type validation errors; avoid cascading errors
          when a grammar for a given namespace is not found, or when components
          from a certain namespace can't be accessed from a given schema
          document.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Sandy Gao'/>
      </update>

      <update>
	<note>Changed the lexical representation of gMonth from "--MM--" to "--MM".
	</note>
	<submitter name='Sandy Gao'/>
      </update>

      <fix>
	<note>Decimal point shouldn't be allowed in integer-derived types;
           "fractionDigits" and "totalDigits" should be calculated on the value space.
	</note>
	<submitter name='Sandy Gao'/>
      </fix>

      <fix>
	<note>Fixed several DOM bugs. Xerces now passes 
	  W3C DOM Level 1 Core test suite.

      well as these XNI improvements and extensions, a host of bugs
      and limitations that existed in Xerces 2.0.0beta4 have been fixed in 
      this release.
