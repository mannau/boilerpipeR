  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
   An XML document is comprised of various entities which can
   be encoded using different character encodings. The document
   instance is known as the <em>document entity</em> whereas
   we'll call the DTD the <em>dtd entity</em>. In addition,
   <em>general entities</em> and <em>parameter entities</em>
   act as macros for inserting fragments into the parse stream 
   when the entity is referenced in the document and DTD, 
   respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   There must be a way to declare, locate, and read 
   entities in their respective character encoding. The entity
   manager handles locating entities and obtaining an entity
   scanner capable of scanning the entity content. Depending on 
   the character encoding, there may be custom readers for
   performance reasons. Regardless of the character encoding,
   though, the interface to scan the underlying content must
   be consistent and simple.
  </p>
  <a name='Overview.Xerces'></a>
  <h3>Xerces</h3>
  <p>
   The complexity of the original Xerces code resulted, in
   large part, from the readers and entity management. The
   entity readers were defined with a large set of methods
   so that read operations could be optimized for each
   reader and that character transcoding could be deferred.
   However, this meant that every reader had to implement
   all of the methods separately which introduced more
   chances for bugs in the code and made it harder to 
   understand the system.
  </p>
  <a name='Overview.Crimson'></a>
  <h3>Crimson</h3>
  <p>
   Crimson took a simpler approach to reading entities.
   There is only one reader class that delegates the read
   calls to a few optimized input stream readers. And
   without attempting to defer character encoding, the
   code path is greatly simplified. But its not all roses.
   If you look deep enough in the code you'll find that
   the entity management code is <em>somewhat</em> complex 
   because of the nature of XML entities.
  </p>
  <a name='Assumptions'></a>
  <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <p>
   Before designing the entity management, a few assumptions 
   were made:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Characters are <em>always</em> transcoded<br>
     <span class='note'>
      This greatly simplifies the system and allows us to avoid
      using a string pool. There <em>is</em> a performance cost 
      but the simplicity and understandability of the code far 
      outweighs any performance lost.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     There will be a single entity manager per parser instance<br>
     <span class='note'>
      Scanners need to have a way of locating entities and
      reading their contents. An entity manager would provide
      that mechanism.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     There will be a single entity scanner per parser instance that 
     XML scanners will use<br>
     <span class='note'>
      This entity scanner can still delegate to custom, optimized
      input stream readers for performance.
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Entity Manager</h2>
  <p>
   The entity manager is a core component in any parser
   configuration and there is only one entity manager per parser
   instance. Some of the responsibilities of the entity 
   manager are:
   <ul>
    <li>Registering declared entities</li>
    <li>Resolving external entities</li>
    <li>Starting entities</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   The <code><a href='design.html#XMLEntityManager'>XMLEntityManager</a></code>
   class implements the entity management in the parser. This
   class contains methods for registering general and parameter 
   entities; resolving entities either by default or by using
   the SAX <code>EntityResolver</code> registered by the user;
   and starting named and unnamed entities. The various XML
   scanners query the entity scanner by calling
   <code>getEntityScanner</code> on the entity manager. 
  </p>
  <a name='EntityScanner'></a>
  <h2>Entity Scanner</h2>
  <p>
   The entity scanner is responsible for scanning "primitive"
   XML structure from an entity and reporting the parse location.
   The <code><a href='design.html#XMLEntityScanner'>XMLEntityScanner</a></code>
   class contains methods to peek at the current character; scan 
   names and content; etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is only one entity scanner per entity manager.
   The entity scanner works directly with the entity manager in
   order to read from the underlying character readers. This
   makes scanning of the entities transparent to the caller.
   Changing readers; auto-detecting encodings from input
   streams; and buffering is done "under the covers" and does 
   not affect how the caller interacts with the entity scanner.
  </p>
  <p>
   If both the entity manager and entity scanner are singletons
   per parser instance, why aren't they a single object?
   The manager and scanner <em>could</em> be a single object
   but they are separate in order to have a cleaner separation
   of functionality and API. Even though they are separate, 
   they share common data, as shown in the following diagram.
  </p>
  <p>
   <table border='2' cellpadding='10' cellspacing='0'>
    <tr class='diagram'>
     <td>
      <table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'>
       <tr>
        <td class='config-component'>
         <table cellpadding='7' cellspacing='2'>
          <tr class='diagram'>
           <td class='component'>Entity<br>Manager</td>
           <td class='component'>Entity<br>Scanner</td>
          </tr>
         </table>
         <li>entity resolver</li>
         <li>reader stack</li>
         <li>entity handler</li>
        </td>
       </tr>
      </table>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </p>
  <a name='Notes'></a>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
   It is expected that the entity management and readers will
   need to be re-evaluated as the Xerces 2 concept is
   implemented. The operation of reading entities directly
   impacts the performance of the parser and while this isn't
   an initial requirement it is important.
  </p>
  <a name='Notes.OpenIssues'></a>
  <h3>Open Issues</h3>
  <p>
   There are currently some open issues. [Note: these should
   move to <a href='issues.html'>implementation issues</a>.]
   <dl>
    <dt>Entity Encoding</dt>
    <dd>
     When an entity is started that is read from an input stream,
     the encoding must first be auto-detected. Then, as the
     appropriate scanner parses the XMLDecl or TextDecl line,
     a new encoding must be set on the entity scanner. An API 
     must be created in order to set the encoding. However,
     the work of swapping out the character reader is done
     transparently from the caller. 
    </dd>
    <dt>Open Readers</dt>
    <dd>
     Who closes open readers? The parser should close all readers
     that it created but should not close any readers that are
     passed to the parser via the <code>parse(InputSource)</code>
     method. And at what time are the readers closed in the case
     of an unrecoverable error?
    </dd>
   </dl>
