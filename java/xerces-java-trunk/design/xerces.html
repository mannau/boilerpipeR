  <h1>Evaluation of Xerces Code</h1>
  <a name='Overview'></a>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
   Historically, the <a href='http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/'>Xerces</a>
   code was developed to be the fastest 
   <a href='http://www.w3.org/XML/'>XML</a> parser on the planet.
   This impacted design decisions and caused the parser to be
   written from the inside out. While this produced an extremely
   fast XML parser with DTD validation, the overall design
   suffered. Xerces developers have found it difficult to understand, 
   fix bugs, and add new features. Hence the Xerces2 effort.

  <h2>The Good</h2>
  <p>
   <table border='0'>
    <tr>
     <th>Standards:</th>
     <td>
      The Xerces parser is an extremely complete XML parser. Besides
      conforming to the XML and Namespace specifications, it offers
      support for SAX 1 and 2; DOM Level 1 and 2; and most of
      the latest working draft of XML Schema.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Modularity:</th>
     <td>
      The current Xerces code made a decent attempt at modularity by
      defining a set of interfaces between components of the parser
      such as the scanner and validator. The parser is designed as 
      a pipeline of components. This is a good idea whose implementation
      got complicated by performance considerations and feature creep.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Validation:</th>
     <td>
      Xerces is able to validate documents with grammars specified
      in DTD and XML Schema syntax. All validation is performed by
      a universal validator that can validate the union of features
      found in both syntaxes. This enables the parser to handle
      current and future grammars in a consistent way.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Performance:</th>
     <td>
      The Xerces parser has always performed well. Implementation of
      XML Schema has caused the performance to slip but this is to
      be expected -- you can't do a lot more work per element without
      incurring a performance penalty.
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>

  <h2>The Bad</h2>
  <p>
   <table border='0'>
    <tr>
     <th>Size:</th>
     <td>
      The parser is too big but this is not all due to the code
      required to parse XML files. A lot of contributed features
      have been rolled into the Xerces jar file. For example: 
      HTML and WML DOM implementations; document serializers; etc.
      It would be nice to find a way to package the features into
      separate distributable jars.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Simplicity:</th>
     <td>
      The code needs to be simplified. A lot of complexity of the
      Xerces parser can be found in the entity readers and the use
      of the string pool throughout the system.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Documentation:</th>
     <td>
      This is little to no documentation of the Xerces code. And
      frequently the javadoc comments are missing or incorrect. 
      More effort must be taken in Xerces 2 in order to make sure 
      that everything is well documented.
