  <h1>Coding Conventions</h1>
  <a name='TheProblem'></a>
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
   As with any coding effort, there are always arguments over
   what coding conventions to use. Everyone thinks that they
   have the best style which leads to the entire source tree 
   looking different. This causes consternation as 
   well as eye fatigue on subsequent developers that need to 
   maintain the code. Therefore, we are going to make an 
   <em>attempt</em> at defining some basic coding conventions 
   for the Xerces 2 concept implementation.
  </p>
  <a name='Conventions'></a>
  <h2>Conventions</h2>
  <a name='Conventions.Comments'></a>
  <h3>Comments</h3>
  <p>
   In general, code should be documented with comments. Complete
   javadoc comments should be used for interfaces and classes;
   constants; fields; methods; etc, regardless of their
   visibility.
  </p>
  <a name='Conventions.Whitespace'></a>
  <h3>Whitespace</h3>
  <p>
   Do not indent using tab characters -- they invariably display 
   differently in everyone's editor or development environment. 
   If your editor does this by default, then turn that feature off.
   Use 4 space characters for each indention level. Also, each 
   line of code, with indentation, should not exceed 80 characters. 
  </p>
  <a name='Conventions.Names'></a>
  <h3>Names</h3>
  <p>
   The convention for names is pretty easy and follows the 
   standard Java coding convention, except where there is no common
   convention. Unless otherwise stated, all names will follow
   the "camel-case" convention where the first letter of each
   word in the name is capitalized while the remaining letters
   are left lowercase (e.g. "camelCase"). Words in the name
   shall not be separated with underscore ('_') characters.
  </p>
  <p>
   <dl>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.InterfacesAndClasses'></a>
    <dt>Interfaces &amp; Classes</dt>
    <dd>
     The names of interfaces and classes shall start with an
     uppercase letter and follow the standard camel-case
     convention. If a word in the name is an acronym, the
     acronym is left uppercase.
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> StringBuffer XMLDocumentHandler</li>
      <li><strong>Bad:</strong> stringBuffer XmlDocumentHandler</li>
     </ul>
    </dd>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.Constants'></a>
    <dt>Constants</dt>
    <dd>
     Constant names are the one major place where the convention
     for names is not followed. The names of constants shall be
     written in uppercase, separating each word in the name with
     an underscore character.
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> WRONG_DOCUMENT</li>
      <li><strong>Bad:</strong> wrongDocument</li>
     </ul>
    </dd>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.Fields'></a>
    <dt>Fields</dt>
    <dd>
     The naming convention for fields differ than the code in
     the standard Java libraries where each field starts with a 
     lowercase letter and then uses camel-case for the field 
     name. Subsequently, using these field names in code causes 
     confusion as to whether a field is local to the method or 
     global to the class. Because there are different types of
     fields, we have selected different types of conventions
     which are detailed below. When naming a field, follow the
     first rule that applies, with the rules appearing first
     in this list having more precedence.
    </dd>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.PublicFields'></a>
    <dt>Public Fields</dt>
    <dd>
     When a class is designed to be used as a "structure" with 
     public fields, follow the standard Java convention. For an
     example of a	 structure, refer to the
     <a href='design.html#QName'>QName</a> class.
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> type value</li>
      <li><strong>Bad:</strong> fType</li>
     </ul>
    </dd>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.LocalFields'></a>
    <dt>Local Fields</dt>
    <dd>
     The letter 'f' is used as a prefix on fields with local
     object scope. Acronyms are still capitalized as part of
     the field name.
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> fStack fIANA2JavaMap</li>
      <li><strong>Bad:</strong> uri</li>
     </ul>
    </dd>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.StaticFields'></a>
    <dt>Static Fields</dt>
    <dd>
     Static fields are prefixed with an 'f' to denote that it
     is a field and a 'g' to denote that it's scope is global
     to <em>all</em> instances of that class.
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Good:</strong> fgData</li>
      <li><strong>Bad:</strong> data</li>
     </ul>
    </dd>
    <a name='Conventions.Names.Methods'></a>
    <dt>Methods</dt>
    <dd>
     Method names follow the camel-case rule.
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </p>
  <a name='Conventions.BlockStyle'></a>
  <h3>Block Style</h3>
  <p>
   Another controversial coding convention is the code block
   style. For the code in the Xerces2 implementation, it is 
   agreed to use the following block style:
   <ul>
    <li>All indent levels are 4 space characters</li>
    <li>Opening brace on same line as start of block</li>
    <li>Code is indented 4 space characters from start of block</li>
    <li>Closing brace on separate line and aligned with start of block</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is an example:
   <pre>
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        // do something
    }
   </pre>
  </p>
