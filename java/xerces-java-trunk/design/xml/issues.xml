  <title>Entity Management &amp; Readers</title>
  <detail>
   The heart of parsing XML documents is the interaction between
   the various scanners and the document input stream. Since this
   is the critical path in the parser, performance is an important
   consideration. Yet, at the same time, the interaction between
   scanner and reader should be simple and straightforward.
  </detail>
  <problem>
   <detail>
    Entity stack management. The scanners can push readers on the
    stack when an entity reference is seen but who pops the reader?
   </detail>
  </problem>
  <problem>
   <detail>
    Who scans the XMLDecl and TextDecl lines? The scanner(s) or
    the entity reader?
   </detail>
  </problem>
  <problem>
   <detail>
    Handling the changing of the input stream reader based
    on the encoding specified in the XMLDecl or TextDecl lines.
   </detail>
  </problem>
  <problem>
   <detail>
    How do we handle the pushback buffer needed at certain
    times during parsing while still keeping the amount of
    delegation down to a minimum?

  <title>Parser Pipeline Construction</title>
  <detail>
   The parser is designed as a pipeline and the components need
   to be connected together and configured.
  </detail>
  <problem>
   <detail>
    Is there a generic way to put components together in 
    order to construct the pipeline? If users want to
    construct a new parser object with a different pipeline
    configuration, this should be easy to do.

  <title>Operations on XML Infoset</title>
  <detail>
   There are many emerging XML standards that involve operations
   on the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset'>XML Infoset</a>.
   <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude'>XInclude</a> is one of
   these standards that defines how XML inclusion operates on the
   Infoset.
  </detail>
  <problem>
   <detail>
    When should these operations take place in the parser 
    pipeline: before or after validation? And if it's after 
    validation, then what does it mean for the parser to say a 
    document is "valid"? The inclusion could cause the document to 
    become invalid. This is more than an implementation issue; it's
    a standards issue.
   </detail>
   <comment author='estaub' link='http://archive.covalent.net/xml/xerces-j-dev/2000/09/0482.xml'>
    If XInclude processing were called after validation, then what would be
    validated would be the unexpanded XInclude.  In other words, the schema or
    DTD would describe the original unexpanded xinclude:href attributes, and so
    forth.

  <problem>
   <detail>
    Should operations on the XML Infoset even be in the parser
    pipeline?
